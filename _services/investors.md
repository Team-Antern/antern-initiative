## How I-Invest works for Investors?

We have four step process to make sure you invest in the right person and get the good returns on your investment:

1. When you sign-up on I-Invest, you will be asked to fill a form which will help us to understand your investment budget and requirements (don't worry even if you wanna invest 5k, we will help you to find the right person).
2. We will then match you with the right person based on your requirements.
3. We go through couple of interview sessions with the person you are investing in and make sure you are investing in the right person.
4. Once you are happy with the person, we will help you to finalize the agreement of the returns which you will get on your investment.

> People invest in stocks, which are ofc uncertain, but we invest in people, who are certain.

While investing stocks, companies, it's really hard to predict the future, but when you invest in people, you can predict the future. We have seen people who are really good at what they do, but they don't have the resources to grow and build the future. We want to help them to get the resources and grow.

## What kind of returns can an investor can expect?

There are several types of returns which investor can ask for with the person they are investing in, some of them are:

1. Getting some percentage of their salary after they get a job for a period of time.
2. Getting some percentage of their business profits after they start their own business.
3. Taking help from them in their personal work without paying them.
4. Lending them as a loan and getting the interest on the loan.
   and lot more...

> Note: You can expect minimum of 2 returns from a person you are investing in.

## How we make sure that the person we are investing in is good?

### Intense Determination

Intense determination is the most important thing which makes a person good. If a person is determined to do something, he/she will do it. We have seen people who are really good at what they do, but they don't have the resources to grow and build the future. We want to help them to get the resources and grow.

### Desperation

The factor of desperation is also important. If a person is desperate to do something, he/she will do it like if someone is facing strong financial crisis, he/she will do anything to get out of it.

### Passion

Passion is the third thing which makes a person good, if they are passionate about what they want to do, you can expect great returns from them/

> Note: We do extensive background and identity checks on the person we are investing in.
