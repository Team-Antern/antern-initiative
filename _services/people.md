## How we evaluate you?

### Intense Determination

Intense determination is the most important thing which makes a person good. If a person is determined to do something, he/she will do it. We have seen people who are really good at what they do, but they don't have the resources to grow and build the future. We want to help them to get the resources and grow.

### Desperation

The factor of desperation is also important. If a person is desperate to do something, he/she will do it like if someone is facing strong financial crisis, he/she will do anything to get out of it.

### Passion

Passion is the third thing which makes a person good, if they are passionate about what they want to do, you can expect great returns from them/
